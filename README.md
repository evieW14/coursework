Evie White's MUWFC Tracker Coursework entry

This is a tracker for the Manchester United Women's Team 24-25 WSL campaign.

It includes data about the entire squad, some key staff members, and their FA WSL fixtures.  
The user can select one of 5 options.
1. View Squad + Staff
2. View Player Details
3. Match Results
4. Match Update
5. Exit

The tracker allows the user to update the scores of the teams matches and also update the appearances of the players who 
appeared in that matchday, the goals of any goalscorers in this fixture and also the assists of the players who provided 
the assist for the goal. 

This project only includes data from the FA WSL campaign but may be extended in future to include FA Cup, Conti Cup and
any possible Champions League campaign. Too, the project may be extended to include more stats about the players 
including more position-related stats (like tackles for defenders of average shots for strikers etc.)
